# What is Jumbled ?
**Jumbbled** is a game where a player is presented with a set of scrambled letters and must unscramble them to form a valid word. The game is usually played by one person. Jumble games are often used as a fun way to improve vocabulary, spelling, and problem-solving skills.

## How does it work ?
Jumbled has tons of words about 3000 words. 

Way to play this game --
1) First a player needs to select a difficulty-level option between Easy, Medium, or Hard. By clicking the level button, `random` words will appear one by one out of 10 and a timer will start.

    - For `Easy` level:  less than 5 letters word will appear
    - For `Medium` level: 5 to 7 letters word will appear
    - For `Hard` level: greater than 8 letters word will appear
    
2) Then the player needs to guess the valid word using all jumbled letters and then click `Submit` button to check whether the word is correct or not , if it's correct then it will show the new word else the player needs to guess again.

3) If a player is unable to guess the word then the player can skip the word by clicking the `Skip` Button.

4) For each correct guess player will get `20 points`.

5) After finishing all words a `dialog box` will appear, which shows the `total score` with a `message` and `Play Again` and `Exit` options.
